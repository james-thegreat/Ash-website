  <Strong>Note:</Strong>
  I am upskilling in React and Next.js. However, when I attended a 'Summer of Tech' meet and
  greet, I spoke to a React developer and mentioned I was upskilling in both. My conversation 
  with him led me to believe that using Next.js for this website would probably be overkill, as 
  the client's needs just called for frontend development, which I feel React would suffice for. 
  Plus, this developer also pointed out something I had not considered: using Vercel, which is
  connected to Next.js, is expensive, and for a small company, I want to have as little long-term 
  cost for the client as possible. However, I will continue to upskill by using the Next.js App Router 
  tutorial, because I feel it is a better tutorial for helping me to understand the ins and outs of React. 
  Plus, you can never be too prepared.
